Dated December 21, 2018.

I'm Nitro. As of the date of writing, I am a high school student in my senior year, planning to go into computer science.

I've always been mature for my age; having more company in adults than in other kids in my year group helped make me solitary. I took to computers to get away from this. I'm a gifted student, and I've had success in my classes, in my extracurricular activities, in my hobbies, in math contests. I'm like Ender Wiggin. I'm at the top, and because of it I'm all alone.

I can handle it, though. I keep myself busy. And I try not to indulge in too much self-pity.
